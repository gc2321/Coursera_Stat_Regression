## Analysis of mtcars dataset and determine the relationship of variables and fuel consumption

### Summary
Fuel consumption (mpg) of manual transmission cars is signficantly (alpha=0.05) higher than that of automatic transmission cars.

Fuel consumption (mpg) negatively correlates with number of cylinders (cyl), gross horsepower(hp) and weight (wt, lb/1000). A linear model with these three variables are sufficient in predicting mpg with an adjusted R-squared value of 0.8263. Weight is the most dominant predictor in this model.
